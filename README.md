This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using both lexicon-based and deep learning–based NLP approaches. The goal is to compare traditional sentiment scoring with modern transformer models.

🔹 Methods Used

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner)
Lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis suitable for short texts.

RoBERTa Pretrained Model (Hugging Face)
Transformer-based model for accurate sentiment classification.

Hugging Face Pipeline
Simplified interface for applying pretrained NLP models.

🔹 Workflow

Text preprocessing and tokenization using NLTK

Sentiment scoring with VADER

Sentiment prediction using RoBERTa

Comparison of sentiment outputs across different models

Analysis and visualization of sentiment results

🔹 Technologies

Python · NLTK · Hugging Face Transformers · VADER · Pandas · Matplotlib
